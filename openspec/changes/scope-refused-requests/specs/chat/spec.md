## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Backend contract

The system SHALL use the following dashboard routes, JSON-RPC methods and events for chat, and SHALL parse session rows leniently, skipping rows that do not fit.

#### Scenario: REST routes

- **WHEN** the chat reads or changes threads
- **THEN** it uses `GET /api/sessions` (`limit`, `offset`, `order=recent`, `archived=exclude`, `profile`; response `sessions` and optionally `total`), `GET /api/sessions/{id}/messages` (`profile`; response `messages`), `PATCH /api/sessions/{id}` (body with `title`, `pinned` or `archived`, and `profile`) and `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}` (`profile`)
- **AND** it uses `GET /api/profiles/active` to learn which profile to list, `POST /api/auth/ws-ticket` (response `ticket`) and `GET /` (the `__HERMES_SESSION_TOKEN__` value) to obtain socket credentials

#### Scenario: Row fields

- **WHEN** a session row is parsed
- **THEN** `id`, `title`, `preview`, `last_active`, `started_at` and `pinned` are read
- **AND** a message row's `id`, `role`, `content`, `timestamp` and `tool_calls` are read, and a loaded message's id is `<session id>-<row id>`

#### Scenario: JSON-RPC methods

- **WHEN** the chat talks over `/api/ws`
- **THEN** it requests `session.create` (optional `profile`), `session.resume` (`session_id`, optional `profile`), `prompt.submit` (`session_id`, `text`), `approval.respond` (`session_id`, `request_id`, `choice`; a `resolved` result above zero means accepted) and `clarify.respond` (`request_id`, `answer`, optional `question_id`; a `status` of `expired` means not accepted), `client.capabilities` (`server_requests`) and `clarify.lock` (`request_id`, `question_id`, `answer`; a `status` of `expired` means not accepted), as JSON-RPC 2.0 with integer ids
- **AND** the gateway binds a session to the profile it was created or resumed under, so `prompt.submit` and the answer calls carry no profile
- **AND** it answers a secret or a sudo request only to skip it: `sudo.respond` (`request_id`, `password` empty) or `secret.respond` (`request_id`, `value` empty), where a `status` of `expired` means not accepted

#### Scenario: Unknown profile

- **WHEN** `session.create` or `session.resume` carries a `profile` that names no profile on the host
- **THEN** a Hermes newer than the ref pinned for the contract test answers with the JSON-RPC error 4064 and a message naming the profile; the system treats that code as "the selected profile no longer exists" and reads nothing else from the error
- **AND** an older Hermes may drop the socket instead, which the system treats as any other socket drop

#### Scenario: Server-to-client requests

- **WHEN** the gateway sends a JSON-RPC request with a string id and a `method`
- **THEN** `approval` (`session_id`, `command`, `description`, `choices`) shows an approval card, and `clarify` (`session_id` with either `question`, `choices`, `multi_select` or a `questions` list of `qid`, `question`, `choices`, `multi_select`) shows a clarify card, both keyed by the request's `id`
- **AND** `secret` and `sudo` show the card for requests the app cannot answer, reading nothing but the `id` and the session
- **AND** any other method is answered at once with the JSON-RPC error -32601 "method not found" when its `session_id` is a runtime session this app has a reply in flight for
- **AND** an unhandled request for any other session is neither shown nor answered, because another client attached to that session may answer it, and the first response settles it for all of them
- **AND** a request whose `session_id` is not the reply's runtime session is left alone

#### Scenario: Answering a server-to-client request

- **WHEN** the user answers an approval
- **THEN** a response frame `{id, result: {choice}}` is sent with the request's id
- **AND WHEN** the user answers a single clarify question
- **THEN** a response frame `{id, result: {answer}}` is sent, the answer being the JSON-encoded list for a multi-select question
- **AND WHEN** the user answers one question of a batch
- **THEN** `clarify.lock` is requested with the request's id as `request_id`, and its result decides whether the answer was accepted
- **AND WHEN** the user skips a `secret` or `sudo` request
- **THEN** a response frame `{id, result: {value: ''}}` is sent with the request's id
- **AND WHEN** the user skips a whole batch
- **THEN** a response frame with an empty result is sent with the request's id, and `clarify.lock` is not requested

#### Scenario: Events

- **WHEN** the gateway pushes an `event` notification
- **THEN** its `type` is mapped as follows: `message.start` (reply started), `message.delta` (`text`), `tool.start` (`name`, `context`), `tool.complete` (`name`, `result.error`), `session.title` (`title`), `message.complete` (`text`, `status`), `approval.request` (`request_id`, `command`, `description`, `choices`), `clarify.request` (`request_id` with either `question`, `choices`, `multi_select` or a `questions` list of `qid`, `question`, `choices`, `multi_select`), `secret.request` and `sudo.request` (`request_id` only; the prompt, variable name and metadata are not read), and `approval.expire`, `clarify.expire`, `secret.expire` or `sudo.expire` (`request_id`), and `request.cancel` (`id`, the id of a server-to-client request)
- **AND** other event types are ignored

#### Scenario: Socket closes

- **WHEN** the socket closes
- **THEN** all pending requests fail with a "connection closed" error, later requests fail at once, and frames that are not JSON-RPC are ignored
